			<h1>ABOUT PAGE</h1>
			<br>
			<p>Welcome to our website! We understand that finding the right accommodation can be a daunting task for most of the students. That's why we have put together a comprehensive list of accommodations near universities, ranging from temporary to permanent options. Our user-friendly interface allows you to easily search for accommodation options that fit your needs and budget. We also provide detailed information about each accommodation, including location, amenities, and reviews from previous tenants. We hope that our website will make your transition to studying abroad as seamless as possible.</p>
			<br><h1>HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS WEBSITE</h1>
			<br><p>At our website, we understand that every student has unique requirements, which is why we offer a wide range of accommodation options. Whether you are looking for a private room or a shared apartment, we have got you covered.

			<br><h1>FUTURE SCOPE</h1>
			<br><p>In the future, we plan to expand our offerings to include additional features that will make the process of finding accommodation even easier. For example, we may introduce a chatbot that can help you with any questions or concerns you may have during your search. We may also add more options for student-friendly accommodation in all universities, such as homestays or co-living spaces.</p>
